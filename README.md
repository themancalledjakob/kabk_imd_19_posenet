# Unity setup

You need to download Unity3D Community (Personal):

https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

And you also need an editor for the code.

I recommend for macOS and Linux:

https://www.monodevelop.com/download/

And for Windows:

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/unity-tools/

during installing you will be asked to install build tools.

install:
`Linux Build Support`
`WebGL Build Support`

If you're on a Windows computer also install:
`Windows Build Support`

If you're on a Mac also install:
`Mac Build Support`

When installing Visual studio it asks you to install workloads, select:
- `.NET desktop development`
- `Desktop development with C++`
- `Universal Windows Platform development`

When you installed everything, open Unity and create an account

# Unity usage

download this repository or clone it, if you didn't already do it

- open Unity
- open the folder `kabk_imd_19_posenet/unityExamples/unityWebsockets/` in Unity

# Troubleshooting
## you cannot run the posenet camera tracker.
When you run the posenet camera with `yarn start`, you get an error that something is already running on port 3000.
Check the whole error message for the PID number of the process blocking this port.

then type in the terminal: `kill -9 <PID number>`
for example: 

`kill -9 67832`

then try again. Should you have trouble with this, a simple reboot will fix it as well.

## you can run everything, you get no errors, but somehow the examples do not react on the camera.
Probably you have the posenet camera tracker running in a hidden tab. The posenet camera tracker has(!) to be in focus a.k.a. visible, otherwise it's execution is paused and nothing is happening.

- let me know when you run into other errors or troubles! I will put here a FAQ :-)
